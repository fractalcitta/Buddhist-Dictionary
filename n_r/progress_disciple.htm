      <h2>progress of the disciple</h2>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </b>Gradual development of the Eightfold Path in the: In many suttas occurs
    an identical passage that outlines the gradual course of development in the
    progress of the disciple. There it is shown how this development takes place
    gradually, and in conformity with laws, from the very first hearing of the
    doctrine, and from germinating faith and dim comprehension, up to the final
    realization of deliverance.</p>
  <p>&quot;After hearing the law, he is filled with confidence, and he thinks: &#39;Full of
    hindrances is household life, a refuse heap; but the homeless life (of a monk)
    is like the open air. Not easy is it, when one lives at home, to fulfill in all
    points the rules of the holy life. How if now I were to cut off hair and beard,
    put on the yellow robe, and go forth from home to the homeless life?&#39; And after
    a short time, having given up his possessions, great or little, having forsaken
    a circle of relations, small or large, he cuts off hair and beard, puts on the
    yellow robe, and goes forth from home to the homeless life.</p>
  <p>Having thus left the world, he fulfills the rules of the monks. He avoids the
    killing of living beings and abstains from it; without stick or sword,
    conscientious, full of sympathy, he is desirous of the welfare of all living
    beings. He avoids stealing ... avoids unchastity ... avoids lying ...
    tale-bearing ... harsh language ... vain talk.</p>
  <p>&quot;He abstains from destroying vegetal germs and plants; eats only at one time
    of the day; keeps aloof from dance, song, music and the visiting of shows;
    rejects floral adornment, perfumes, ointment, as well as any other kind of
    adornment and embellishment. High and gorgeous beds he does not use. Gold and
    silver he does not accept ... keeps aloof from buying and selling things ....</p>
  <p>&quot;He contents himself with the robe that protects his body, and with the
    alms-bowl with which he keeps himself alive. Wherever he goes, he is provided
    with these two things, just as a winged bird in flying carries its wings along
    with him.</p>
  <p>&quot;By fulfilling this noble domain of morality <i>(sīla) </i>he feels in his
    heart an irreproachable happiness.&quot;</p>
  <p>In what follows thereafter it is shown how the disciple watches over his 5
    senses and his mind, and by this noble restraint of the senses <i>
      (indriya-samvara)</i> feels in his heart an unblemished happiness; how in all
    his actions he is ever mindful and clearly conscious; and how, being equipped
    with this lofty morality <i>(sīla),</i> and with this noble restraint of the
    senses<i> (indriya-samvara), </i>and with mindfulness and clear consciousness <i>
      (sati-sampajañña),</i> he choses a secluded dwelling, and freeing his mind from
    the 5 hindrances <i>(<a href="niivarana.htm">nīvarana</a>, </i>q.v.) he reaches full concentration <i>
      (<a href="../s_t/samaadhi.htm">samādhi</a>, </i>q.v.); and how thereafter, by developing insight
    <i>(vipassanā </i>q.v.) with regard to the impermanency <i>(anicca),</i> misery
    <i>(dukkha)</i> and impersonality <i>(<a href="../a/anatta.htm">anattā</a>, </i>q.v.) of all phenomena of
    existence, he finally realizes deliverance from all cankers and defilements, and
    thus the assurance arises in him:
