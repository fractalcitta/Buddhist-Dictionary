<p> </b>(lit. &#39;name and form&#39;): &#39;mind-and-body&#39;, mentality and corporeality. It 
is the 4th link in the dependent origination (s. <i><a href="paticca_samuppaada.htm">paticcasamuppāda</a></i>
3, 4) where it is conditioned by consciousness, and on its part is the condition 
of the sixfold sense-base. In two texts (D. 14, 15), which contain variations of 
the dependent origination, the mutual conditioning of consciousness and 
mind-and-body is described (see also S. XII, 67), and the latter is said to be a 
condition of sense-impression <i>(phassa); </i>so also in Sn. 872.</p>
<p>The third of the seven purifications (s. <i><a href="../u_v/visuddhi.htm">visuddhi</a>),</i>
the purification of views, is defined in Vis.M. XVIII as the &quot;correct seeing of 
mind-and-body,&quot; and various methods for the discernment of mind-and-body by way 
of insight-meditation<i> (<a href="../u_v/vipassanaa.htm">vipassanā</a>,</i> q.v.) are given there. In this context, 
&#39;mind&#39; <i>(nāma)</i> comprises all four mental groups, including consciousness. 
- See <i><a href="naama.htm">nāma</a>.</i></p>
<p>In five-group-existence <i>(<a href="panca_vokaara_bhava.htm">pañca-vokāra-bhava</a>,</i> q.v.), mind-and body are 
inseparable and interdependent; and this has been illustrated by comparing them 
with two sheaves of reeds propped against each other: when one falls the other 
will fall, too; and with a blind man with stout legs, carrying on his shoulders 
a lame cripple with keen eye-sight: only by mutual assistance can they move 
about efficiently (s. Vis.M. XVIII, 32ff). On their mutual dependence, see also <i>
<a href="paticca_samuppaada.htm">paticca-samuppāda</a></i> (3).</p>
<p>With regard to the impersonality and dependent nature of mind and 
corporeality it is said:</p>
<p>&quot;Sound is not a thing that dwells inside the conch-shell and comes out from 
time to time, but due to both, the conch-shell and the man that blows it, sound 
comes to arise: Just so, due to the presence of vitality, heat and 
consciousness, this body may execute the acts of going, standing, sitting and 
lying down, and the 5 sense-organs and the mind may perform their various 
functions&quot; (D. 23).</p>
<p>&quot;Just as a wooden puppet though unsubstantial, lifeless and inactive may by 
means of pulling strings be made to move about, stand up, and appear full of 
life and activity; just so are mind and body, as such, something empty, lifeless 
and inactive; but by means of their mutual working together, this mental and 
bodily combination may move about, stand up, and appear full of life and 
activity.&quot;</p>
