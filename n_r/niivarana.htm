<p>&#39;hindrances&#39;, are 5 qualities which are obstacles to the mind and blind 
our mental vision. In the presence of them we cannot reach 
neighbourhood-concentration <i>(upacāra-samādhi) </i>and full concentration <i>
(appanā-samādhi), </i>and are unable to discern clearly the truth. They are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>sensuous desire <i>(kāmacchanda),</i></li>
          <li>ill-will <i>(vyāpāda),</i></li>
          <li>sloth and torpor <i>(thīna-middha),</i></li>
          <li>restlessness and scruples <i>(uddhacca-kukkucca), </i>and</li>
          <li>skeptical doubt <i>(<a href="../u_v/vicikicchaa.htm">vicikicchā</a></i>).</li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In the beautiful similes in A.V.193, sensuous desire is compared with water 
mixed with manifold colours, ill-will with boiling water, sloth and torpor with 
water covered by moss, restlessness and scruples with agitated water whipped by 
the wind, skeptical doubt with turbid and muddy water. Just as in such water one 
cannot perceive one&#39;s own reflection, so in the presence of these 5 mental 
hindrances, one cannot clearly discern one&#39;s own benefit, nor that of others, 
nor that of both.</p>
<p>Regarding the temporary suspension of the 5 hindrances on entering the first 
absorption, the stereotype sutta text (e g. A.IX.40) runs as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>&quot;He has cast away sensuous desire; he dwells with a heart free from sensuous 
desire; from desire he cleanses his heart.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>&quot;He has cast away ill-will; he dwells with a heart free from ill-will, 
cherishing love and compassion toward all living beings, he cleanses his heart 
from ill-will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>&quot;He has cast away sloth and torpor; he dwells free from sloth and torpor; 
loving the light, with watchful mind, with clear consciousness, he cleanses his 
mind from sloth and torpor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>&quot;He has cast away restlessness and scruples; dwelling with mind undisturbed, 
with heart full of peace, he cleanses his mind from restlessness and scruples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>&quot;He has cast away skeptical doubt; dwelling free from doubt, full of 
confidence in the good, he cleanses his heart from doubt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>&quot;He has put aside these 5 hindrances, and come to know these paralysing 
defilements of the mind. And far from sensual impressions, far from unwholesome 
things, he enters into the first absorption, etc.&quot;</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The overcoming of these 5 hindrances by the absorptions is, as already 
pointed out, a merely temporary suspension, called &#39;overcoming through 
repression&#39; <i>(vikkhambhana-pahāna). </i>They disappear forever on entering the 
4 supermundane paths (s. <i><a href="../a/ariya_puggala.htm">ariyapuggala</a>),</i> 
i.e. skeptical doubt on reaching Sotāpanship; sensuous desire, ill-will and 
mental worry on reaching Anāgāmiship; sloth, torpor and restlessness on reaching 
Arahantship.</p>
<p>For their origination and their overcoming, s. A. I, 2; VI, 21; S. XLVI, 51.</p>
