        <h2>maranānussati</h2>
        <p>&#39;recollection of death&#39;, is one of the 10 recollections treated in
          detail in Vis.M. VIII:</p>
        <p>&#39;&#39;Recollection of death, developed and frequently practised, yields great
          reward, great blessing, has Deathlessness as its goal and object. But how may
          such recollection be developed?</p>
        <p>&quot;As soon as the day declines, or as the night vanishes and the day is
          breaking, the monk thus reflects: &#39;Truly, there are many possibilities for me to
          die: I may be bitten by a serpent, or be stung by a scorpion or a centipede, and
          thereby I may lose my life. But this would be an obstacle for me. Or I may
          stumble and fall to the ground, or the food eaten by me may not agree with my
          health; or bile, phlegm and piercing body gases may become disturbing, or men or
          ghosts may attack me, and thus I may lose my life. But this would be an obstacle
          for me.&#39; Then the monk has to consider thus: &#39;Are there still to be found in me
          unsubdued evil, unwholesome things which, if I should die today or tonight,
          might lead me to suffering?&#39; Now, if he understands that this is the case, he
          should use his utmost resolution, energy, effort, endeavour, steadfastness,
          attentiveness and clear-mindedness in order to overcome these evil, unwholesome
          things&quot; (A VIII, 74).</p>
        <p>In Vis.M. VIII it is said: &#39;He who wishes to develop this meditation, should
          retreat to solitude, and whilst living secluded he should thus wisely reflect:
          &#39;Death will come to me! The vital energy will be cut off!&#39; Or: &#39;Death! Death!&#39;
          To him, namely, who does not wisely reflect, sorrow may arise by thinking on the
          death of a beloved person, just as to a mother whilst thinking on the death of
          her beloved child. Again, by reflecting on the death of a disliked person, joy
          may arise, just as to enemies whilst thinking on the death of their enemies.
          Through thinking on the death of an indifferent person, however, no emotion will
          arise, just as to a man whose work consists in cremating the dead at the sight
          of a dead body. And by reflecting on one&#39;s own death fright may arise ... just
          as at the sight of a murderer with drawn sword one becomes filled with horror.
          Thus, whenever seeing here or there slain or other dead beings, one should
          reflect on the death of such deceased persons who once lived in happiness, and
          one should rouse one&#39;s attentiveness, emotion and knowledge and consider thus:
          &#39;Death will come, etc.&#39; .... Only in him who considers in this way, will the
          hindrances <i>(nīvarana,</i> q.v.) be repressed; and through the idea of death
          attention becomes steadfast, and the exercise reaches
          neighbourhood-concentration <i>(upacāra-samādhi).&quot;</i></p>
        <p>According to Vis.M. VIII, one may also reflect on death in the following
          various ways: one may think of it as a murderer with a drawn sword standing in
          front of oneself; or one may bear in mind that all happiness ends in death; or
          that even the mightiest beings on this earth are subject to death; or that we
          must share this body with all those innumerable worms and other tiny beings
          residing therein; or that life is something dependent on in-and-out breathing,
          and bound up with it; or that life continues only as long as the elements, food,
          breath, etc. are properly performing their functions; or that nobody knows when,
          where, and under what circumstances, death will take place, and what kind of
          fate we have to expect after death; or, that life is very short and limited. As
          it is said: &#39;Short, indeed, is this life of men, limited, fleeting, full or woe
          and torment; it is just like a dewdrop that vanishes as soon as the sun rises;
          like a water-bubble; like a furrow drawn in the water; like a torrent dragging
          everything along and never standing still; like cattle for slaughter that every
          moment look death in the face&quot; (A. VII, 74).</p>
        <p>&quot;The monk devoted to this recollection of death is at all time indefatigable,
          gains the idea of disgust with regard to all forms of existence, gives up
          delight in life, detests evil, does not hoard up things, is free from stinginess
          with regard to the necessities of life, the idea of impermanence <i>(anicca) </i>
          becomes familiar to him; and through pursuing it, the idea of misery <i>(dukkha)</i>
          and of impersonality <i>(anattā)</i> become present to him .... Free from fear
          and bewilderment will he pass away at death; and should he not yet realize the
          Deathless State in his life-time, he will at the dissolution of the body attain
          to a happy course of existence&quot; (Vis.M. VIII).</p>
