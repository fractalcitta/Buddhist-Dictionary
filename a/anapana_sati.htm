  <p>&#39;mindfulness on in-and-out-breathing&#39;,&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    is one of the most important exercises for reaching mental concentration and the
    4 absorptions (<i><a href="../g_m/jhaana.htm">jhāna</a></i>).</p>
  <p>In the Satipatthāna Sutta (M. 10, D. 22) and elsewhere, 4 methods of practice
    are given, which may also serve as basis for insight meditation. The &#39;Discourse
    on Mindfulness of Breathing&#39; (Ānāpānasati Sutta, M. 118) and other texts have 16
    methods of practice, which divide into 4 groups of four. The first three apply
    to both tranquillity (<i><a href="../s_t/samatha.htm">samatha</a></i>) and insight-meditation, while the
    fourth refers to pure insight practice only. The second and the third group
    require the attainment of the absorptions.</p>
  <p>&quot;With attentive mind he breathes in, with attentive mind he breathes out.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I. (1) &quot;When making a long inhalation he knows: &#39;I make a long inhalation&#39;;
      when making a long exhalation he knows: &#39;I make a long exhalation.&#39;</p>
    <p>(2) &quot;When making a short inhalation he knows: &#39;I make a short inhalation&#39;;
      when making a short exhalation he knows: &#39;I make a short exhalation.&#39;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(3) &quot; &#39;Clearly perceiving the entire (breath-) body I will breathe in,&#39;
        thus he trains himself; &#39;clearly perceiving the entire (breath-) body I will
        breathe out,&#39; thus he trains himself.</p>
      <p>(4) &quot; &#39;Calming this bodily function I will breathe in,&#39; thus he trains
        himself; &#39;calming this bodily function I will breathe out,&#39; thus he trains
        himself.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>II. (5) &quot; &#39;Feeling rapture (<i>pīti</i>) I will breathe in,&#39; thus he trains
      himself; &#39;feeling rapture I will breathe out,&#39; thus he trains himself.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(6) &quot; &#39;Feeling joy I will breathe in,&#39; thus he trains himself; &#39;feeling
        joy I will breathe out,&#39; thus he trains himself.</p>
      <p>(7) &quot; &#39;Feeling the mental formation (<i>citta-sankhāra</i>) I will
        breathe in,&#39; thus he trains himself, &#39;feeling the mental formation I will
        breathe out,&#39; thus he trains himself.</p>
      <p>(8) &quot; &#39;Calming the mental formation I will breathe in,&#39; thus he trains
        himself; &#39;calming the mental formation I will breathe out,&#39; thus he trains
        himself.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>III. (9) &quot; &#39;Clearly perceiving the mind (<i>citta</i>) I will breathe in,&#39;
      thus he trains himself; &#39;clearly perceiving the mind I will breathe out,&#39; thus
      he trains himself.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(10) &quot; &#39;Gladdening the mind I will breathe in,&#39; thus he trains himself;
        &#39;gladdening the mind I will breathe out,&#39; thus he trains himself.</p>
      <p>(11) &quot; &#39;Concentrating the mind I will breathe in, thus he trains himself;
        &#39;concentrating the mind I will breathe out&#39;, thus he trains himself.</p>
      <p>(12) &quot; &#39;Freeing the mind I will breathe in,&#39; thus he trains himself;
        &#39;freeing the mind I will breathe out,&#39; thus he trains himself</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>IV. (13) &quot; &#39;Reflecting on impermanence (<i>anicca</i>) I will breathe in,&#39;
      thus he trains himself; &#39;reflecting on impermanence I will breathe out,&#39; thus
      he trains himself.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(14) &quot; &#39;Reflecting on detachment (virāga) I will breathe in,&#39; thus he
        trains himself; &#39;reflecting on detachment I will breathe out,&#39; thus he
        trains himself.</p>
      <p>(15) &quot; &#39;Reflecting on extinction (<i>nirodha</i>) I will breathe in,&#39;
        thus he trains himself; &#39;reflecting on extinction I will breathe out,&#39; thus
        he trains himself.</p>
      <p>(16) &quot; &#39;Reflecting on abandonment (<i>patinissagga</i>) I will breathe
        in, thus he trains himself; &#39;reflecting on abandonment I will breathe out,&#39;
        thus he trains himself.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In M. 118 it is further shown how these 16 exercises bring about the 4
    foundations of mindfulness (<i><a href="../s_t/satipatthaana.htm">satipatthāna</a></i>), namely:&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> 1-4 contemplation of the body,&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> 5-8 contemplation of feeling,&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> 9-12 contemplation of mind (consciousness),&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> 13-16 contemplation of mind-objects.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp;Then it is shown how these 4 foundations of mindfulness bring about the
        7 factors of enlightenment (<i>bojjhanga</i>, q.v.); then these again
        deliverance of mind (<i><a href="../b_f/ceto_vimutti.htm">ceto-vimutti</a></i>) and deliverance through
        wisdom (<i><a href="../n_r/pannaa_vimutti.htm">paññā-vimutti</a></i>).
