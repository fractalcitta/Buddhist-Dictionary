  <p>&#39;attainment of extinction&#39; (S. XIV, 11), also called <i>
      saññā-vedayita-nirodha, </i>&#39;extinction of feeling and perception&#39;, is the
    temporary suspension of all consciousness and mental activity, following
    immediately upon the semi-conscious state called &#39;sphere of
    neither-perception-nor-non-perception&#39; (s. <i><a href="../g_m/jhaana.htm">jhāna</a></i>, 8). The absolutely
    necessary pre-conditions to its attainment are said to be perfect mastery of all
    the 8 absorptions <i>(jhāna),</i> as well as the previous attainment of Anāgāmī
    or Arahantship (s. <i><a href="../a/ariya_puggala.htm">ariya-puggala</a>).</i></p>
  <p>According to Vis.M. XXIII, the entering into this state takes place in the
    following way: by means of mental tranquillity <i>(samatha)</i> and insight <i>
      (vipassanā) </i>one has to pass through all the 8 absorptions one after the
    other up to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and then one has
    to bring this state to an end. If, namely, according to the Vis.M., the disciple
    (Anāgāmī or Arahat) passes through the absorption merely by means of
    tranquillity, i.e. concentration, he will only attain the sphere of
    neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and then come to a standstill; if, on the
    other hand, he proceeds only with insight, he will reach the fruition <i>(phala)</i>
    of Anāgāmī or Arahantship. He, however, who by means of both faculties has risen
    from absorption to absorption and, having made the necessary preparations,
    brings the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception to an end, such a one
    reaches the state of extinction. Whilst the disciple is passing through the 8
    absorptions, he each time emerges from the absorption attained, and regards with
    his insight all the mental phenomena constituting that special absorption, as
    impermanent, miserable and impersonal. Then he again enters the next higher
    absorption, and thus, after each absorption practising insight, he at last
    reaches the state of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and thereafter the
    full extinction. This state, according to the Com., may last for 7 days or even
    longer. Immediately at the rising from this state, however, there arises in the
    Anāgāmī the fruition of Anāgāmiship<i> (anāgāmi-phala), </i>in the Arahat the
    fruition of Arahantship <i>(arahatta-phala).</i></p>

  <p>With regard to the difference existing between the monk abiding in this state
    of extinction on the one hand, and a dead person on the other hand, M 43 says:
    &quot;In him who is dead, and whose life has come to an end, the bodily (in-and-out
    breathing), verbal (thought-conception and discursive thinking), and mental
    functions (s. <i><a href="../s_t/sankhaara.htm">sankhāra</a>,</i> 2) have become
    suspended and come to a standstill, life is exhausted, the vital heat
    extinguished, the faculties are destroyed. Also in the monk who has reached
    &#39;extinction of perception and feeling&#39; <i>(saññā-vedayita-nirodha),</i> the
    bodily, verbal and mental functions have been suspended and come to a
    standstill, but life is not exhausted, the vital heat not extinguished, and the
    faculties are not destroyed.&quot;</p>
