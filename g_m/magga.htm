<p style="margin-bottom: 4">Right view or right understanding<i> (sammā-ditthi) </i>
is the understanding of the 4 Noble Truths about the universality of suffering 
(unsatisfactoriness), of its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to that 
cessation. - See the Discourse on &#39;Right Understanding&#39; (M. 9, tr. and Com. in 
&#39;R. Und.&#39;).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4">Right thought <i>(sammā-sankappa):</i> thoughts free 
from sensuous desire, from ill-will, and cruelty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4">Right speech <i>(sammā-vācā):</i> abstaining from 
lying, tale-bearing, harsh language, and foolish babble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4">Right bodily action<i> (sammā-kammanta): </i>
abstaining from killing, stealing, and unlawful sexual intercourse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4">Right livelihood<i> (sammā-ājīva): </i>abstaining 
from a livelihood that brings harm to other beings, such as trading in arms, in 
living beings, intoxicating drinks, poison; slaughtering, fishing, soldiering, 
deceit, treachery soothsaying, trickery, usury, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4">Right effort <i>(sammā-vāyāma):</i> the effort of 
avoiding or overcoming evil and unwholesome things, and of developing and 
maintaining wholesome things (s. <a href="../n_r/padhaana.htm"><i>padhāna</i></a>).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4">Right mindfulness <i>(sammā-sati):</i> mindfulness

  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4">Right concentration <i>(sammā-samādhi):</i>
concentration of mind associated with wholesome <i>(kusala) </i>consciousness, 
which eventually may reach the absorptions <i>(<a href="jhaana.htm">jhāna</a></i>). 
Cf. <i>
<a href="../s_t/samaadhi.htm">samādhi</a></i>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>There are to be distinguished 2 kinds of concentration, mundane<i> (lokiya) </i>
and supermundane <i>(lokuttara) </i>concentration. The latter is associated with 
those states of consciousness known as the 4 supermundane paths and fruitions 
(s. <i><a href="../a/ariya_puggala.htm">ariya-puggala</a>). </i>As it is said in 
M.117:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you, o monks, there are 2 kinds of right view: the understanding that 
it is good to give alms and offerings, that both good and evil actions will bear 
fruit and will be followed by results.... This, o monks, is a view which, though 
still subject to the cankers, is meritorious, yields worldly fruits, and brings 
good results. But whatever there is of wisdom, of penetration, of right view 
conjoined with the path - the holy path being pursued, this is called the 
supermundane right view <i>(lokuttara-sammā-ditthi),
</i>which is not of the world, but which is supermundane and conjoined with the 
path.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a similar way the remaining links of the path are to be understood.</p>
<p>As many of those who have written about the Eightfold Path have misunderstood 
its true nature, it is therefore appropriate to add here a few elucidating 
remarks about it, as this path is fundamental for the understanding and practice 
of the Buddha&#39;s teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, the figurative expression &#39;path&#39; should not be interpreted to 
mean that one has to advance step by step in the sequence of the enumeration 
until, after successively passing through all the eight stages, one finally may 
reach one&#39;s destination, Nibbāna. If this really were the case, one should have 
realized, first of all, right view and penetration of the truth, even before one 
could hope to proceed to the next steps, right thought and right speech; and 
each preceding stage would be the indispensable foundation and condition for 
each succeeding stage. In reality, however, the links 3-5 constituting moral 
training <i>(sīla), </i>are the first 3 links to be cultivated, then the links 
6-8 constituting mental training <i>(samādhi), </i>and at last right view, etc. 
constituting wisdom<i> (paññā).</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is, however, true that a really unshakable and safe foundation to the path 
is provided only by right view which, starting from the tiniest germ of faith 
and knowledge, gradually, step by step, develops into penetrating insight<i> 
(vipassanā) </i>and thus forms the immediate condition for the entrance into the 
4 supermundane paths and fruits of holiness, and for the realization of Nibbāna. 
Only with regard to this highest form of supermundane insight, may we indeed say 
that all the remaining links of the path are nothing but the outcome and the 
accompaniments of right view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the mundane <i>(lokiya)</i> eightfold path, however, its links may 
arise without the first link, right view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here it must also be emphasized that the links of the path not only do not 
arise one after the other, as already indicated, but also that they, at least in 
part, arise simultaneously as inseparably associated mental factors in one and 
the same state of consciousness. Thus, for instance, under all circumstances at 
least 4 links are inseparably bound up with any karmically wholesome 
consciousness, namely 2, 6, 7 and 8, i.e. right thought, right effort, right 
mindfulness and right concentration (M. 117), so that as soon as any one of 
these links arises, the three others also do so. On the other hand, right view 
is not necessarily present in every wholesome state of consciousness.</p>
