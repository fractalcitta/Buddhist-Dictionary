<h2>vibhajja-vāda</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&#39;analytical or discriminating doctrine&#39; is an early name for the 
original Buddha doctrine, called Theravāda. -  </p>
<p>The term
<i>vibhajja-vādī</i> occurs in M.99 and A.X.94, though not in the sense of a 
separate school, but as a characteristic of the Buddha himself: &quot;Now, by blaming 
what is blamable and praising what is praiseworthy, the Blessed One is a 
&#39;discriminating teacher&#39; <i>(vibhajja-vadī)</i> and is not one-sided in his 
teaching&quot; (A.X.94).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa, in the introduction to his Com. on the Kathāvatthu, says that in 
Asoka&#39;s time, when the Sangha prospered, many heretics took ordination as 
Buddhist monks but continued to spread their wrong doctrines. For purifying the 
Sangha, Asoka, together with the venerable Moggaliputtatissa, summoned assembly 
of the bhikkhus. When each of the assembled was individually questioned by the 
king about what the Buddha taught, those who said that he was an eternalist <i>
(sassata-vadī),</i> etc. were expelled. The genuine bhikkhus replied that the 
Buddha was a <i>vibhajja-vadī,</i> an &#39;analyst&#39; or &#39;discriminating teacher&#39;; and 
when, on the king&#39;s question, Moggaliputtatissa confirmed that this was the 
correct view, those monks were admitted to the Uposatha (q.v.) assembly of the 
Sangha, and from their midst the participants of the 3rd Council at Pataliputta 
were selected. -  </p>
