      <h2>dukkha</h2>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </b>(1) &#39;pain&#39;, painful feeling, which may be bodily and mental (s. <i>
      <a href="../u_v/vedanaa.htm">vedanā</a>).</i></p>

  <p>(2) &#39;Suffering&#39;, &#39;ill&#39;. As the first of the Four Noble Truths (s. <i><a
        href="../s_t/sacca.htm">sacca</a>)</i>
    and the second of the three characteristics of existence (s.
    <i><a href="../s_t/ti_lakkhana.htm">ti-lakkhana</a>),</i> the term <i>dukkha</i> is not limited to painful
    experience
    as under (1), but refers to the unsatisfactory nature and the general insecurity
    of all conditioned phenomena which, on account of their impermanence, are all
    liable to suffering, and this includes also pleasurable experience. Hence
    &#39;unsatisfactoriness&#39; or &#39;liability to suffering&#39; would be more adequate
    renderings, if not for stylistic reasons. Hence the first truth does not deny
    the existence of pleasurable experience, as is sometimes wrongly assumed. This
    is illustrated by the following texts:
  </p>
  <p>&quot;Seeking satisfaction in the world, monks, I had pursued my way. That
    satisfaction in the world I found. In so far as satisfaction existed in the
    world, I have well perceived it by wisdom. Seeking for misery in the world,
    monks, I had pursued my way. That misery in the world I found. In so far as
    misery existed in the world, I have well perceived it by wisdom. Seeking for the
    escape from the world, monks, I had pursued my way. That escape from the world I
    found. In so far as an escape from the world existed, I have well perceived it
    by wisdom&quot; (A.iii.105).</p>
  <p>&quot;If there were no satisfaction to be found in the world, beings would not be
    attached to the world .... If there were no misery to be found in the world,
    beings would not be repelled by the world .... If there were no escape from the
    world, beings could not escape therefrom&quot; (A.iii.106).</p>
