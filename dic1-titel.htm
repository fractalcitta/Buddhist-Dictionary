<p>From The Preface To The First Edition</p>
</font></u></b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a first attempt of an authentic dictionary of Buddhist doctrinal terms, 
  used in the Pāli Canon and its Commentaries, this present manual will fill a 
  real gap felt by many students of Buddhism. It provides the reader not with a 
  mere superficial enumeration of important Pāli terms and their English 
  equivalents, but offers him precise and authentic definitions and explanations 
  of canonical and post-canonical terms and doctrines, based on Sutta, Abhidhamma 
  and Commentaries, and illustrated by numerous quotations taken from these 
  sources, so that, if anyone wishes, he could, by intelligently joining together 
  the different articles, produce without difficulty a complete exposition of the 
  entire teachings of Buddhism.</p>
<p>As already pointed out by the author in the preface to his Guide through the 
  Abhidhamma-Pitaka (Colombo 1938), there are found in the Abhidhamma Canon 
  numerous technical terms not met with in the Sutta Canon; and again other terms 
  are found only in the Commentaries and not in Sutta and Abhidhamma. The author 
  therefore has made a first attempt - without, however, laying any claim to 
  absolute reliability or completeness in this by no means easy undertaking - to 
  indicate in the Appendix all the terms that in the oldest Sutta texts are either 
  not found at all, or at least not in the same form or meaning, and to set forth 
  how far these are deviations from the older texts, or further developments.</p>
<p>In this connection, the author wishes to state that the often quoted 
  Patisambhidā-Magga, as well as Niddesa, Buddhavamsa and Cariyapitaka, though 
  included in the Khuddaka Nikāya of the Sutta Pitaka, nevertheless bear 
  throughout the character of Commentaries, and though apparently older than the 
  Sutta Commentaries handed down to us in Buddhaghosa&#39;s version, must doubtless 
  belong to a later period of origin than the Abhidhamma Canon.</p>
<p>In rendering the terms into English, I often had to differ considerably from 
  the interpretation of Western scholars, and to introduce quite new words. A 
  great number of such earlier translations must be considered partly as totally 
  incorrect, partly as misleading, or at the very least ambiguous. Incorrect are, 
  for instance, the English renderings of <i>nāma-rūpa</i> by &#39;name and form&#39;; <i> javana</i> (impulsion, i.e. the karmic impulsive moments) by &#39;apperception&#39;, 
  etc.</p>
<p>The expositions concerning the true nature of the 8-fold Path, the 4 Noble 
  Truths, the <i>paticca-samuppāda</i> and the 5 groups of existence - doctrines 
  which, with regard to their true nature, have been often misunderstood by 
  Western authors - are sure to come to many as a revelation.</p>
<p>On the doctrine of <i>anattā</i>, or &#39;egolessness&#39;, i.e. the impersonality 
  and emptiness of all phenomena of existence, the author repeatedly felt the 
  necessity of throwing light from every possible point of view, for it is exactly 
  this doctrine which, together with the doctrine of the conditionality of all 
  phenomena of existence, constitutes the very essence of the whole Teaching of 
  the Buddha without which it will be by no means possible to understand it in its 
  true light. Thus the doctrine of impersonality runs like a red thread right 
  through the whole book.</p>
<p>May this little manual provide an ever-helpful companion and <i>vade mecum</i> to all earnest students in their study of the original Buddhist scriptures, and 
  also give to Buddhist authors and lecturers the opportunity of supplementing and 
  deepening their knowledge of the profound teachings of the Buddha!</p>
<p>Should it, for a better understanding, prove necessary to give to certain 
  subjects a more detailed treatment, the carrying out of this task may be 
  reserved for a later edition of this work.</p>

<p>Editor&#39;s Preface To The Third Edition</p>
</font></u></b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The present revised and enlarged Third Edition was intended to be issued in 
  commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the venerable author&#39;s passing away on 
  28th May 1957. But due to unavoidable circumstances the publication had to be 
  delayed.</p>
<p>It was the venerable author&#39;s wish to enlarge the first edition of this work, 
  but when a second edition became necessary, he was prevented from expanding it 
  by the illness to which he later succumbed. It rested, therefore, with his 
  pupil, the present editor, to make, within the original scope and character of 
  the work, such additions and revisions as seemed useful.</p>
<p>Over seventy articles have been expanded and partly rewritten; others were 
  slightly revised; more source references were included, and information on 
  literature for further study of the respective subjects was added to some of the 
  articles. But only very few new words have been added (e.g. <i>anupassanā, ānupubbi-kathā</i>, etc.). This restriction was observed because 
  the venerable author himself thought only of &#39;a more detailed treatment&#39; of 
  existing articles (see Preface to the 1st ed.) as he obviously wished to 
  preserve the original form and character of the book. It was also considered 
  that the adding of more words such as those coined in later commentarial and 
  abhidhammic literature, would be superfluous as in the English language such 
  terms will generally be found only in a few scholarly books and translations 
  which themselves give the explanations needed.</p>
<p>This book is chiefly intended for those who study the Buddhist teachings 
  through the medium of the English language, but wish to familiarize themselves 
  with some of the original Pāli terms of doctrinal import. They are in the same 
  position as a student of philosophy or science who has to know the terminology 
  of his field, which for common parlance is mostly not less &#39;unfamiliar&#39; than are 
  the words of the Pāli language found in the Dictionary.</p>
<p>Such acquaintance with the Pāli terms of the original texts will also be 
  useful to the student for the purpose of identifying the various renderings of 
  them favored by different translators. It is deplorable that there is a 
  considerable multiplication of new English coining for the same doctrinal term. 
  This great variety of renderings has proved to be confusing to those students of 
  Buddhism who are not familiar with the Pāli language. Even at this late stage 
  when many translations of Pāli texts are in print, it will be desirable if, for 
  the sake of uniformity, translators forgo their preference for their own 
  coining, even if they think them better than others. In any case, doctrinal 
  terms have to be known by definition, just as in the case of philosophical and 
  technical terms in a Western language.</p>
<p>As a small help in the situation described, a number of alternative 
  renderings used by other translators have been included in some articles of this 
  edition. In a very few cases, unacceptable though familiar renderings have been 
  bracketed. The Venerable Nyanatiloka&#39;s own preferences have been placed in 
  inverted commas. Generally it may be said that his renderings, based on his 
  comprehensive knowledge of texts and doctrine, are very sound and adequate. Only 
  in a very few cases has the editor changed the author&#39;s preferred rendering e.g. 
  &#39;canker&#39; for <i>āsava</i> (instead of &#39;bias&#39;), &#39;right view&#39; for <i>sammā-ditthi</i> (instead of &#39;right understanding&#39;). The latter change was made for the sake of 
  economizing with the few English equivalents for the numerous Pāli synonyms for 
  &#39;knowing&#39;, etc.; and also to avoid having to render the opposite term, <i> micchā-ditthi</i>, by &#39;wrong understanding&#39;.</p>
<p>This Dictionary appeared also in the author&#39;s own German version (published 
  by Verlag Christiani, Konstanz, Germany) and in a French translation made by the 
  late Mme Suzanne Karpeles (published by &#39;Adyar&#39;, Paris, 1961).</p>
