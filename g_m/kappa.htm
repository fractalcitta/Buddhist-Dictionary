  </ul>
  <p> </b>(Sanskrit<i> kalpa):</i> &#39;world-period&#39;, an inconceivably long space of
    time, an aeon. This again is subdivided into 4 sections: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>world-dissolution <i>(samvatta-kappa) </i>dissolving world), </li>
    <li>continuation of the chaos<i> (samvatta-tthāyī),</i> </li>
    <li>world-formation <i>(vivatta-kappa),
      </i></li>
    <li>continuation of the formed world <i>(vivatta-tthāyī).</i></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&quot;How long a world-dissolution will continue, how long the chaos, how long the
    formation, how long the continuation of the formed world, of these things; o
    monks, one hardly can say that it will be so many years, or so many centuries,
    or so many millennia, or so many hundred thousands of years&quot; (A.IV.156)</p>
  <p>A detailed description of the 4 world-periods is given in that stirring
    discourse on the all-embracing impermanence in A.VII.62.</p>
  <p>The beautiful simile in S.XV.5 may be mentioned here: &quot;Suppose, o monks,
    there was a huge rock of one solid mass, one mile long, one mile wide, one mile
    high, without split or flaw. And at the end of every hundred years a man should
    come and rub against it once with a silken cloth. Then that huge rock would wear
    off and disappear quicker than a world-period. But of such world-periods, o
    monks, many have passed away, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundred
    thousands. And how is this possible? Inconceivable, o monks, is this <a href="../s_t/samsaara.htm">
      samsāra</a>, not to be discovered is any first beginning of beings, who
    obstructed by ignorance and ensnared by craving, are hurrying and hastening
    through this round of rebirths.&quot;</p>
  <p>Compare here Grimm&#39;s German fairy-tale of the little shepherd boy: &#39;In
    Farther Pommerania there is the diamond-mountain, one hour high, one hour wide,
    one hour deep. There every hundred years a little bird comes and whets its
    little beak on it. And when the whole mountain is ground off, then the first
    second of eternity has passed.&quot;</p>
