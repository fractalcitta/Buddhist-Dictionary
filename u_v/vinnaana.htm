<p></b>&#39;consciousness&#39;, is one of the 5 groups of existence (aggregates;<i>
<a href="../g_m/khandha.htm">khandha</a></i>); one of the 4 nutriments<i> (<a href="../a/ahara.htm">āhāra</a></i>); 
the 3rd link of the dependent origination <i>(<a href="../n_r/paticca_samuppaada.htm">paticcasamuppāda</a></i>); 
the 5th in the sixfold division of elements <i>(<a href="../b_f/dhaatu.htm">dhātu</a></i>).</p>
<p>Viewed as one of the 5 groups <i>(khandha),</i> it is inseparably linked with 
the 3 other mental groups (feeling, perception and formations) and furnishes the 
bare cognition of the object, while the other 3 contribute more specific 
functions. Its ethical and karmic character, and its greater or lesser degree of 
intensity and clarity, are chiefly determined by the mental formations 
associated with it.</p>
<p>Just like the other groups of existence, consciousness is a flux <i>
(viññāna-sotā,
</i>&#39;stream of c.&#39;) and does not constitute an abiding mind-substance; nor is it 
a transmigrating entity or soul. The 3 characteristics (s.<i>
<a href="../s_t/ti_lakkhana.htm">ti-lakkhana</a>), </i>impermanence, suffering 
and no-self, are frequently applied to it in the texts (e.g., in the 
Anattalakkhana Sutta, S.XXII, 59). The Buddha often stressed that &quot;apart from 
conditions, there is no arising of consciousness&#39; (M 38); and all these 
statements about its nature hold good for the entire range of consciousness, be 
it &quot;past, future or presently arisen, gross or subtle, in oneself or external, 
inferior or lofty, far or near&quot; (S. XXII, 59).</p>
<p>According to the 6 senses it divides into 6 kinds, viz. eye- (or visual) 
consciousness <i>(cakkhu-v.),</i> etc. About the dependent arising of these 6 
kinds of consciousness, Vis.M. XV, 39 says: &#39;Conditioned through the eye, the 
visible object, light and attention, eye-consciousness arises. Conditioned 
through the ear, the audible object, the ear-passage and attention, 
ear-consciousness arises. Conditioned, through the nose, the olfactive object, 
air and attention, nose-consciousness arises. Conditioned through the tongue, 
the gustative object, humidity and attention, tongue-consciousness arises. 
Conditioned through the body, bodily impression, the earth-element and 
attention, body-consciousness arises. Conditioned through the subconscious mind
<i>(bhavanga-mano), </i>the mind-object and attention, mind-consciousness 
arises.&quot;</p>
<p>The Abhidhamma literature distinguishes 89 classes of consciousness, being 
either karmically wholesome, unwholesome or neutral, and belonging either to the 
sense-sphere, the fine-material or the immaterial sphere, or to supermundane 
consciousness. See <a href="../table1.htm">Table I.</a></p>
