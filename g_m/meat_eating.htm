      <h2>meat-eating</h2>

  </ul>
  <p> </b>Just as the karmical, i.e. moral, quality of any action is determined by
    the quality of volition <i>(cetanā)</i> underlying it, and independently of this
    volition nothing whatever can be called karmically wholesome or unwholesome <i>
      (kusala, akusala), </i>just so it is with the merely external act of
    meat-eating, this being as such purely non-moral, i.e. karmically neutral <i>
      (avyākata).</i></p>

  <p>&#39;In 3 circumstances meat-eating is to be rejected: if one has seen, or heard,
    or suspects (that the animal has been slaughtered expressly for one&#39;s own sake)&quot;
    (M. 55). For if in such a case one should partake of the meat, one would as it
    were approve the murder of animals, and thus encourage the animal-murderer in
    his murderous deeds. Besides, that the Buddha never objected, in ordinary
    circumstances, to meat-eating may be clearly understood from many passages of
    the Suttas (e.g. A. V. 44; VIII, 12; M. 55, etc.), as also from the Vinaya,
    where it is related that the Buddha firmly rejected Devadatta&#39;s proposal to
    forbid meat-eating to the monks; further from the fact that 10 kinds of meat
    were (for merely external reasons) forbidden to the monks, namely from
    elephants, tigers, serpents, etc.</p>
