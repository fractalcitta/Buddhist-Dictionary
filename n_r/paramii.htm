		<p>&#39;perfection&#39;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p> Ten qualities leading to Buddha-hood: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>(1) perfection in giving (or liberality; <i>dāna-pāramī</i>)</li>
		<li>(2) morality (<i>sīla-p</i>.)</li>
		<li>(3) renunciation (<i>nekkhamma-p</i>.)</li>
		<li>(4) wisdom (<i>paññā-p</i>.)</li>
		<li>(5) energy (<i>viriya-p</i>.)</li>
		<li>(6) patience (or forbearance; <i>khanti p</i>.)</li>
		<li>(7) truthfulness (<i>sacca-p</i>.)</li>
		<li>(8) resolution (<i>adhitthāna-p</i>.)</li>
		<li>(9) loving-kindness (<i>mettā-p</i>.) </li>
		<li>(10) equanimity (<i>upekkhā-p</i>.)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These qualities were developed and brought to maturity by the
		<a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/b/bodhisatta.htm">Bodhisatta</a> in his past
		existences, and his way of practising them is illustrated in many of the Birth
		Stories (Jātaka), of which, however, only the verses are regarded as canonical.
		Apart from the latter, the 10 <i>pāramī</i> are mentioned in only two other
		canonical works which are probably apocryphal, the
		<a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/b/buddhavamsa.htm">Buddhavamsa</a> (in the Story of
		Sumedha) and the
		<a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/c/cariyaapitaka.htm">Cariyapitaka</a>. A long and
		methodical exposition of the <i>pāramī</i> is given in the concluding
		Miscellaneous Section <i>(pakinnakakathā)</i> of the Com. to Cariyapitaka
	</p>
	<p>In Vis.M. IX it is said that through developing the 4 sublime states
		(loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, equanimity; s. <i>
			<a href="../b_f/brahma_vihaara.htm">brahma-vihāra</a>),</i>
		one may reach these 10 perfections, namely:</p>
	<p>&quot;As the Great Beings <i>(mahā-satta; </i>a synonym often found in the
		Mahāyana scriptures for
		<a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/b/bodhisatta.htm">Bodhisatta</a>, i.e. &#39;Enlightenment
		Being or Being destined for Buddha-hood) are concerned about the welfare of
		living beings, not tolerating the suffering of beings, wishing long duration to
		the higher states of happiness of beings, and being impartial and just to all
		beings, therefore:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>they give alms (<a href="../b_f/daana.htm"><i>dāna</i></a>) to all beings so
			that they may be happy, without Investigating whether they are worthy or
			not. </li>
		<li>By avoiding to do them any harm, they observe morality (<a href="../s_t/siila.htm"><i>sīla</i></a>).
		</li>
		<li>In order to bring morality to perfection, they train themselves in
			renunciation (nekkhamma). </li>
		<li>In order to understand clearly what is beneficial and injurious to
			beings, they purify their wisdom (paññā). </li>
		<li>For the sake of the welfare and happiness of others they constantly
			exert their energy (viriya). </li>
		<li>Though having become heroes through utmost energy, they are nevertheless
			full of forbearance (khanti) toward s the manifold failings of beings. </li>
		<li>Once they have promised to give or do something, they do not break their
			promise (&#39;truthfulness&#39;; sacca). </li>
		<li>With unshakable resolution (adhitthāna) they work for the weal and
			welfare of beings. </li>
		<li>With unshakable kindness (mettā) they are helpful to all. </li>
		<li>By reason of their equanimity (upekkhā) they do not expect anything in
			return&quot; (Vis.M. IX.24).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In the Mahāyana scriptures, where the <i>pāramī</i> occupy a much more
		prominent place, a partly differing list of six is given: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>liberality, </li>
		<li>morality, </li>
		<li>patience, </li>
		<li>energy, </li>
		<li>meditation</li>
		<li>wisdom.</li>
	</ul>
