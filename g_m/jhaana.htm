<p>&#39;absorption&#39; (meditation) refers chiefly to the four meditative 
absorptions of the fine-material sphere <i>(rūpa-jjhāna </i>or
<i>rūpāvacara-jjhāna;</i> s. <i><a href="../a/avacara.htm">avacara</a>).</i> </p>
<p> They are achieved through the attainment of full (or attainment -, or 
ecstatic) concentration <i>(appanā, </i>s.
<i><a href="../s_t/samaadhi.htm">samādhi</a>),</i> during which there is a 
complete, though temporary, suspension of fivefold sense-activity and of the 5 
hindrances (s. <i>
<a href="../n_r/niivarana.htm">nīvarana</a>).</i> </p>
<p> The state of consciousness, however, is one of full alertness and lucidity. 
This high degree of concentration is generally developed by the practice of one 
of the 40 subjects of tranquility meditation<i> (samatha-kammatthāna; </i>s. <i>
<a href="../b_f/bhaavanaa.htm">bhāvanā</a>).</i> </p>
<p> Often also the 4 immaterial spheres <i>(arūpāyatana) </i>are called 
absorptions of the immaterial sphere <i>(arūpa-jjhāna </i>or <i>
arūpāvacara-jjhāna).</i>
The stereotype text, often met with in the Suttas, runs as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &quot;Detached from sensual objects, o monks, detached from unwholesome 
consciousness, attached with thought-conception (<i>vitakka</i>) and discursive 
thinking <i>(vicāra), </i>born of detachment<i> (vivekaja) </i>and filled with 
rapture <i>(pīti)</i> and joy<i> (sukha)</i> he enters the first absorption.</p>
<p>(2) &quot;After the subsiding of thought-conception and discursive thinking, and 
by gaining inner tranquility and oneness of mind, he enters into a state free 
from thought-conception and discursive thinking, the second absorption, which is 
born of concentration<i> (samādhi), </i>and filled with rapture <i>(pīti) </i>
and joy <i>(sukha).</i></p>

<p>(3) &quot;After the fading away of rapture he dwells in equanimity, mindful, 
clearly conscious; and he experiences in his person that feeling of which the 
Noble Ones say, &#39;Happy lives the man of equanimity and attentive mind&#39;; thus he 
enters the 3rd absorption.</p>
<p>(4) &quot;After having given up pleasure and pain, and through the disappearance 
of previous joy and grief, he enters into a state beyond pleasure and pain, into 
the 4th absorption, which is purified by equanimity <i>(upekkhā) </i>and 
mindfulness.</p>
<p>(5) &quot;Through the total overcoming of the perceptions of matter, however, and 
through the vanishing of sense-reactions and the non-attention to the 
perceptions of variety, with the idea, &#39;Boundless is space&#39;, he reaches the 
sphere of boundless space <i>(ākāsānañcāyatana) </i>and abides therein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&quot;By &#39;perceptions of matter&#39; <i>(rūpa-saññā) </i>are meant the absorptions of 
the fine-material sphere, as well as those objects themselves . . . &quot; (Vis.M. 
X.1).</p>
<p>&quot;By &#39;perceptions of sense-reactions&#39; <i>(patigha-saññā)</i>
are meant those perceptions that have arisen due to the impact of sense-organs 
(eye, etc.) and the sense-objects (visible objects, etc.). They are a name for 
the perception of visible objects, as it is said (Jhāna-Vibh.): &#39;What are here 
the perceptions of sense-reactions? They are the perceptions of visible objects, 
sounds, etc.&#39; - Surely, they do no longer exist even for one who has entered the 
1st absorption, etc., for at such a time the five-sense consciousness is no 
longer functioning. Nevertheless, this is to be understood as having been said 
in praise of this immaterial absorption, in order to incite the striving for it&quot; 
(Vis.M. X.16).</p>
<p>&quot;Perceptions of variety <i>(ñānatta-saññā)</i> are the perceptions that arise 
in various fields, or the various perceptions&quot; (ib.). Hereby, according to 
Vis.M. X.20, are meant the multiform perceptions outside the absorptions.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(6) &quot;Through the total overcoming of the sphere of boundless space, and with 
the idea &#39;Boundless is consciousness&#39;, he reaches the sphere of boundless 
consciousness<i> (viññānañcāyatana) </i>and abides therein.</p>
<p>(7) &quot;Through the total overcoming of the sphere of boundless consciousness, 
and with the idea &#39;Nothing is there&#39;, he reaches the sphere of nothingness <i>
(ākiñcaññāyatana) </i>and abides therein.</p>
<p>(8) &quot;Through the total overcoming of the sphere of nothingness he reaches the 
sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception <i>(nevasaññā-n&#39;asaññāyatana)
</i>and abides therein.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thus the 1st absorption is free from 5 things (i.e. the hindrances, <i>
<a href="../n_r/niivarana.htm">nīvarana</a></i>), and 5 things are present (i.e. 
the factors of absorption; <i>jhānanga).</i> Whenever the monk enters the 1st 
absorption, there have vanished sensuous desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, 
restlessness and scruples, doubts; and there are present: thought-conception<i> 
(vitakka),</i>
discursive thinking <i>(vicāra) </i>rapture <i>(pīti), </i>joy<i> (sukha), </i>
and concentration <i>(samādhi). </i>In the 2nd absorption there are present: 
rapture, joy and concentration; in the 3rd: joy and concentration; in the 4th: 
equanimity<i> (upekkhā) </i>and concentration&quot; (Vis.M. IV).</p>
<p>The 4 absorptions of the immaterial sphere (s. above 5-8) still belong, 
properly speaking, to the 4th absorption as they possess the same two 
constituents. The 4th fine-material absorption is also the base or starting 
point <i>(<a href="../n_r/paadaka_jjhaana.htm">pādaka-jhāna</a>,</i> q.v.) for 
the attaining of the higher spiritual powers <i>(<a href="../a/abhinna.htm">abhiññā</a></i>).</p>
<p>In the Abhidhamma, generally a fivefold instead of a fourfold division of the 
fine-material absorptions is used: the 2nd absorption has still the constituent 
&#39;discursive thinking&#39; (but without thought-conception), while the 3rd, 4th and 
5th correspond to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th, respectively, of the fourfold division 
(s. <a href="../table1.htm">Tab.I. 9- 13</a>) . This fivefold division is based 
on sutta texts like A . VIII, 63 .</p>
<p>For the 8 absorptions as objects for the development of insight (<i>vipassanā</i>), 
see <a href="../s_t/samatha_vipassanaa.htm"> <i>samatha</i>-<i>vipassanā</i></a>. 
- Full details in Vis.M. IV-X.</p>
<p>Jhāna in its widest sense (e.g. as one of the 24 conditions; s. <i><a href="../n_r/paccaya.htm">
paccaya</a></i> 17), denotes any, even momentary or weak absorption of mind, 
when directed on a single object.</p>
