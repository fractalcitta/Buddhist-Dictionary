  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>anussati</h2>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&#39;recollection&#39;, meditation, contemplation. The six recollections often
    described in the Suttas (e.g. A.VI.10, 25; D.33) are:

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>(1) recollection of the Buddha, </li>
    <li>(2) his Doctrine, </li>
    <li>(3) his Community of noble disciples, </li>
    <li>(4) of morality, </li>
    <li>(5) liberality, </li>
    <li>(6) heavenly beings (<i>buddhānussati, dhammānussati, sanghānussati,
        sīlānussati, cāgānussati, devatānussati</i>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(1) &quot;The noble disciple, Mahānāma, recollects thus: &#39;This Blessed One is
    holy, a fully Enlightened One, perfected in wisdom and conduct, faring happily,
    knower of the worlds, unsurpassed leader of men to be trained, teacher of
    heavenly beings and men, a Buddha, a Blessed One.&#39;</p>
  <p>(2) &#39;Well proclaimed by the Blessed One is the Doctrine (<i>dhamma</i>),
    directly visible, with immediate fruit, inviting investigation, leading on to
    Nibbāna, to be comprehended by the wise, each by himself.&#39;</p>
  <p>(3) &#39;Of good conduct is the Community (<i>Sangha</i>) of the Blessed One&#39;s
    disciples, of upright conduct, living on the right path, performing their
    duties, to wit: the 4 pairs of men or 8 individuals (s. <i>
      <a href="ariya_puggala.htm">ariya puggala</a></i>). This Community of the
    Blessed One&#39;s disciples is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of
    gifts, worthy of reverence with raised hands, the unsurpassed field for doing
    meritorious deeds.&#39;</p>
  <p>(4) &quot;The noble disciple further recollects his own morality (<i>sīla</i>) which is
    unbroken, without any breach, undefiled, untarnished, conducive to liberation,
    praised by the wise, not dependent (on craving or opinions), leading to
    concentration.</p>
  <p>(5) &quot;The noble disciple further recollects his own liberality (<i>cāga</i>)
    thus: &#39;Blessed truly am I, highly blessed am I who, amongst beings defiled with
    the filth of stinginess, live with heart free from stinginess, liberal,
    open-handed, rejoicing in giving, ready to give anything asked for, glad to give
    and share with others.&#39;</p>
  <p>(6) &quot;The noble disciple further recollects the heavenly beings (<i>devatā</i>):
    &#39;There are the heavenly beings of the retinue of the Four Great Kings, the
    heavenly beings of the World of the Thirty-Three, the Yāmadevas ... and there
    are heavenly beings besides (s. <i>
      <a href="../b_f/deva.htm">deva</a></i>). Such faith, such morality, such
    knowledge, such liberality, such insight, possessed of which those heavenly
    beings, after vanishing from here, are reborn in those worlds, such things are
    also found in me.&#39; &quot; (A. III,70; VI,10; XI,12).</p>
  <p>&quot;At the time when the noble disciple recollects the Perfect One ... at such a
    time his mind is neither possessed of greed, nor of hate, nor of delusion. Quite
    upright at such a time is his mind owing to the Perfect One ... With upright
    mind the noble disciple attains understanding of the sense, understanding of the
    law, attains joy through the law. In the joyous one rapture arises. With heart
    enraptured, his whole being becomes stilled. Stilled within his being, he feels
    happiness; and the mind of the happy one becomes firm. Of this noble disciple it
    is said that amongst those gone astray, he walks on the right path, among those
    suffering he abides free from suffering. Thus having reached the stream of the
    law, he develops the recollection of the Enlightened One....&quot; (A.VI.10).</p>
  <p>In A.I.21 (PTS: I, xvi) and A.I.27 (PTS: xx. 2) another 4 recollections are
    added: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>mindfulness on death (<i><a href="../g_m/marana.htm">marana-sati</a></i>),
    </li>
    <li>on the body (<i><a href="../g_m/kaaya_gata_sati.htm">kāyagatā-sati</a></i>), </li>
    <li>on breathing (<i><a href="anapana_sati.htm">ānāpāna-sati</a></i>), and </li>
    <li>the recollection of peace (<i><a href="../u_v/upasamaanussati.htm">upasamānussati</a></i>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first six recollections are fully explained in Vis.M. VII, the latter
    four in Vis.M. VIII.</p>
