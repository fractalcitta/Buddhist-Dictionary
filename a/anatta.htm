    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&#39;not-self&#39;, non-ego, egolessness, impersonality,&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    is the last of the three characteristics of existence (<i><a href="../s_t/ti_lakkhana.htm">ti-lakkhana</a></i>,
    q.v.)
    The <i>anattā</i> doctrine teaches that neither within the bodily and mental
    phenomena of existence, nor outside of them, can be found anything that in the
    ultimate sense could be regarded as a self-existing real ego-entity, soul or any
    other abiding substance.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This is the central doctrine of Buddhism, without understanding which a real
    knowledge of Buddhism is altogether impossible. It is the only really specific
    Buddhist doctrine, with which the entire Structure of the Buddhist teaching
    stands or falls. All the remaining Buddhist doctrines may, more or less, be
    found in other philosophic systems and religions, but the <i>anattā</i>-doctrine
    has been clearly and unreservedly taught only by the Buddha, wherefore the
    Buddha is known as the <i>anattā-vādi</i>, or &#39;Teacher of Impersonality&#39;.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    Whosoever has not penetrated this impersonality of all existence, and does not
    comprehend that in reality there exists only this continually self-consuming
    process of arising and passing bodily and mental phenomena, and that there is no
    separate ego-entity within or without this process, he will not be able to
    understand Buddhism, i.e. the teaching of the 4 Noble Truths (<i>sacca</i>,
    q.v.), in the right light. He will think that it is his ego, his personality,
    that experiences suffering, his personality that performs good and evil actions
    and will be reborn according to these actions, his personality that will enter
    into Nibbāna, his personality that walks on the Eightfold Path. Thus it is said
    in Vis.M. XVI:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <dl>
            <div>
              <dt>&quot;Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;</dt>
            </div>
            <div>
              <dt>The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;</dt>
            </div>
            <div>
              <dt>Nibbāna is, but not the man that enters it;</dt>
            </div>
            <div>
              <dt>The path is, but no traveler on it is seen.&quot;</dt>
            </div>
          </dl>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Whosoever is not clear with regard to the conditionally arisen phenomena,
    and does not comprehend that all the actions are conditioned through ignorance,
    etc., he thinks that it is an ego that understands or does not understand, that
    acts or causes to act, that comes to existence at rebirth .... that has the
    sense-impression, that feels, desires, becomes attached, continues and at
    rebirth again enters a new existence&quot; (Vis.M. XVII. 117).</p>
  <p>While in the case of the first two characteristics it is stated that all
    formations (<i>sabbe sankhārā</i>) are impermanent and subject to suffering, the
    corresponding text for the third characteristic states that &quot;all things are
    not-self&quot; (<i>sabbe dhammā anattā;</i> M. 35, Dhp. 279). This is for emphasizing
    that the false view of an abiding self or substance is neither applicable to any
    &#39;formation&#39; or conditioned phenomenon, nor to Nibbāna, the Unconditioned Element
    (<i>asankhatā</i> <i>dhātu</i>).</p>
  <p>The Anattā-lakkhana Sutta, the &#39;Discourse on the Characteristic of Not-self&#39;,
    was the second discourse after Enlightenment, preached by the Buddha to his
    first five disciples, who after hearing it attained to perfect Holiness (<i>arahatta</i>).</p>
  <p>The contemplation of not-self (<i>anattānupassanā</i>) leads to the emptiness
    liberation (<i>suññatā-vimokkha,</i> s. <i><a href="../u_v/vimokkha.htm">vimokkha</a></i>). Herein the faculty of
    wisdom (<i>paññindriya</i>) is outstanding, and one who attains in that way the
    path of Stream-entry is called a Dhamma-devotee (<i>dhammānusāri</i>; s. <i>
      <a href="ariya_puggala.htm">ariya-puggala</a></i>); at the next two stages of sainthood he becomes a
    vision-attainer (<i>ditthippatta</i>); and at the highest stage, i.e. Holiness,
    he is called &#39;liberated by wisdom&#39; (<i>paññā-vimutta</i>).</p>
