      <h2>patisambhidā</h2>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p></b>&#39;analytical knowledge&#39; or &#39;discrimination&#39;, is of 4 kinds: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>analytical knowledge of the true meaning <i>(attha-patisambhidā), </i>
    </li>
    <li>of the law <i>(dhamma-patisambhidā), </i></li>
    <li>of language <i>(nirutti-patisambhidā), </i></li>
    <li>of ready wit <i>(patibhāna-patisambhidā).</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>As an alternative rendering of the fourth term <i>(patibhāna), </i>Bhikkhu
    Ñānamoli proposes: perspicuity (in expression and knowledge).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. The analytical knowledge of the meaning <i>(attha-p.)</i> is the
      knowledge with regard to the sense.</li>
    <li>2. The analytical knowledge of the law <i>(dhamma-p.)</i> is the knowledge
      with regard to the law.</li>
    <li>3. The analytical knowledge of language <i>(nirutti-p.)</i> is the
      knowledge of the language with regard to those former 2 things.</li>
    <li>4. The analytical knowledge of ready-wit <i>(patibhāna-p.) </i>is the
      knowledge about the (former 3) kinds of knowledge&quot; (Vibh. XV).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;(1)<i> attha </i>(Sanskrit<i> artha, <font FACE="Symbol">√</font> ar,</i> to
    reach; result, meaning, purpose, true substance) designates, in short, the fruit
    <i>(phala)</i> of a cause <i>(hetu);</i> for since the fruit of a cause results
    from adhering to the cause, and is reached and effected thereby, therefore it is
    called result <i>(attha).</i> In particular, however, 5 things are considered as
    <i>attha, </i>namely: everything dependent on conditions, Nibbāna, the meaning
    of words, karma-result, and functional consciousness. When anyone reflects on
    that meaning any knowledge of his, falling within the category concerned with
    meaning (or result), is the &#39;analytical knowledge&#39; of meaning.
  </p>
  <p>&quot;(2) <i>dhamma</i> (Sanskrit <i>dharma,</i>
    <font FACE="Symbol">√</font> <i>
      dhar,</i> to bear; bearer, condition, law, phenomenon, thing) is, in short, a
    name for condition <i>(paccaya)</i>.... In particular, however, 5 things are
    considered as <i>dhamma,</i> namely: every cause <i>(hetu)</i> producing a
    result, the noble path, the spoken word, the karmically wholesome, the
    karmically unwholesome. When anyone reflects on that law, any knowledge of his,
    falling within the category concerned with law (or cause), is the &#39;analytical
    knowledge&#39; of the law.
  </p>
  <p>In Vibh. it is further said: &#39;The knowledge of suffering is the &#39;analytical
    knowledge&#39; of the true meaning <i>(attha-patisambhidā), </i>the knowledge of its
    origin is the &#39;analytical knowledge&#39; of the law <i>(dhamma-patisambhidā).</i>
    The knowledge of the cause is the &#39;analytical knowledge&#39; of the law <i>
      (dhamma-patisambhidā),
    </i>the knowledge of the result of the cause is the &#39;analytical knowledge&#39; of
    the true meaning <i>(attha-patisambhidā)</i>... That the monk knows the law, the
    sunas etc. this is called the &#39;analytical knowledge&#39; of the law <i>
      (dhamma-patisambhidā);</i>
    if however, he understands the meaning of this or that speech... it is called
    the &#39;analytical knowledge&#39; of the true meaning<i> (attha-patisambhidā).&#39;</i></p>
  <p>(3) &quot; &#39;The knowledge of the language concerning those things&#39; means: the
    language corresponding to reality, and the unfailing mode of expression
    concerning the true meaning and the law.</p>
  <p>(4) &quot; &#39;Knowledge about the kinds of knowledges&#39; is that knowledge which has
    all knowledges as object and considers them. Or, the analytical knowledge of
    ready wit <i>(patibhāna-patisambhidā)</i> means the knowledge of the above
    mentioned 3 kinds of knowledge, in all their details, with their objects,
    functions, etc.&quot; (Vis.M. XIV).</p>
  <p>On the 7 qualities leading to the attainment of the 4 &#39;analytical knowledge&#39;
