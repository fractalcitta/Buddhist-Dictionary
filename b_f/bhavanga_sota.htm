<ul>
  <li>
<h2>bhavanga-sota </b>and <b>bhavanga-citta</b></h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The first term may tentatively be rendered as the &#39;undercurrent forming the 
condition of being, or existence&#39;, and the second as &#39;subconsciousness&#39;, though, 
as will be evident from the following, it differs in several respects from the 
usage of that term in Western psychology. </p>
<p> <i>Bhavanga</i> (<i>bhava-anga</i>), which, in the canonical works, is 
mentioned twice or thrice in the Patthāna, is explained in the Abhidhamma 
commentaries as the foundation or condition (<i>kārana</i>) of existence (<i>bhava</i>), 
as the <i>sine qua non</i> of life, having the nature of a process, lit. a flux 
or stream (<i>sota</i>). Herein, since time immemorial, all impressions and 
experiences are, as it were, stored up, or better said, are functioning, but 
concealed as such to - full consciousness, from where however they occasionally 
emerge as subconscious phenomena and approach the threshold of full 
consciousness, or crossing it become fully conscious. This so-called 
&#39;subconscious life-stream&#39; or undercurrent of life is that by which might be 
explained the faculty of memory, paranormal psychic phenomena, mental and 
physical growth, karma and rebirth. etc. An alternative rendering is 
&#39;life-continuum&#39;.</p>
<p>It should be noted that <i>bhavanga-citta</i> is a karma-resultant state of 
consciousness (<i><a href="../u_v/vipaaka.htm">vipāka</a></i>, q.v.), and that, in birth as a human or in higher 
forms of existence, it is always the result of good, or wholesome karma (<i>kusala-kamma-vipāka</i>), 
though in varying degrees of strength (s. <i>patisandhi</i>, end of the 
article). The same holds true for rebirth consciousness (<i>patisandhi</i>) and 
death consciousness (<i>cuti</i>), which are only particular manifestations of 
subconsciousness. In Vis.M. XIV it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As soon as rebirth-consciousness (in the embryo at the time of conception) 
  has ceased, there arises a similar subconsciousness with exactly the same 
  object, following immediately upon rebirth-consciousness and being the result of 
  this or that karma (volitional action done in a former birth and remembered 
  there at the moment before death). And again a further similar state of 
  subconsciousness arises. Now, as long as no other consciousness arises to 
  interrupt the continuity of the life-stream, so long the life-stream, like the 
  flow of a river, rises in the same way again and again, even during dreamless 
  sleep and at other times. In this way one has to understand the continuous 
  arising of those states of consciousness in the life-stream.&quot; </p>
